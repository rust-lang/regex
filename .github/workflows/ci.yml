# The section is needed to drop write-all permissions that are granted on
# `schedule` event. By specifying any permission explicitly all others are set
# to none. By using the principle of least privilege the damage a compromised
# workflow can do (because of an injection or compromised third party tool or
# action) is restricted. Currently the worklow doesn't need any additional
# permission except for pulling the code. Adding labels to issues, commenting
# on pull-requests, etc. may need additional permissions:

  # This job runs a stripped down version of CI to test the MSRV. The specific
  # reason for doing this is that the regex crate's dev-dependencies tend to
  # evolve more quickly. There isn't as tight of a control on them because,
  # well, they're only used in tests and their MSRV doesn't matter as much.
  #
  # It is a bit unfortunate that our MSRV test is basically just "build it"
  # and pass if that works. But usually MSRV is broken by compilation problems
  # and not runtime behavior. So this is in practice good enough.
