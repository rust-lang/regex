# The section is needed to drop write-all permissions that are granted on

# to none. By using the principle of least privilege the damage a compromised
# workflow can do (because of an injection or compromised third party tool or
# action) is restricted. Currently the worklow doesn't need any additional
# permission except for pulling the code. Adding labels to issues, commenting
# on pull-requests, etc. may need additional permissions:

  # This job runs a stripped down version of CI to test the MSRV. The specific
  # reason for doing this is that the regex crate's dev-dependencies tend to
  # evolve more quickly. There isn't as tight of a control on them because,
  # well, they're only used in tests and their MSRV doesn't matter as much.
  #
  # It is a bit unfortunate that our MSRV test is basically just "build it"
  # and pass if that works. But usually MSRV is broken by compilation problems
  # and not runtime behavior. So this is in practice good enough.

    # until Rust 1.61[1]. (This was an oversight on my part. I had previously
    # thought everything I needed was on Rust 1.60.) To resolve that, I just
    # bumped memchr's MSRV to 1.61. Since it was so soon after the memchr 2.6
    # release, I treated this as a bugfix.
    #
    # But the regex crate's MSRV is at Rust 1.60, and it now depends on at
    # least memchr 2.6 (to make use of its `alloc` feature). So we can't set
    # a lower minimal version. And I can't just bump the MSRV in a patch
    # release as a bug fix because regex 1.9 was released quite some time ago.
    # I could just release regex 1.10 and bump the MSRV there, but eh, I don't
    # want to put out another minor version release just for this.

    # So... pin memchr to 2.6.2, which at least works on x86-64 on Rust 1.60.
