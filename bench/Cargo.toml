# Use features to conditionally compile benchmarked regexes, since not every
# regex works on every engine. Additionally, it is useful to be able to build
# each benchmark individually, so that not all dependencies are required to
# run only one benchmark.
#
# Note that when running benchmarks, only ONE feature should be set at a time.
# Doing anything else will probably result in weird "duplicate definition"
# compiler errors.
#
# Tip: use the `bench/run` script (in this directory) to run benchmarks.
