/// An abstraction for building Thompson NFAs by hand.
///
/// A builder is what a [`thompson::Compiler`](crate::nfa::thompson::Compiler)
/// uses internally to translate a regex's high-level intermediate
/// representation into an [`NFA`].
///
/// The primary function of this builder is to abstract away the internal
/// representation of an NFA and make it difficult to produce NFAs are that
/// internally invalid or inconsistent. This builder also provides a way to
/// add "empty" states (which can be thought of as unconditional epsilon
/// transitions), despite the fact that [`thompson::State`](nfa::State) does
/// not have any "empty" representation. The advantage of "empty" states is
/// that they make the code for constructing a Thompson NFA logically simpler.
///
/// Many of the routines on this builder may panic or return errors. Generally
/// speaking, panics occur when an invalid sequence of method calls were made,
/// where as an error occurs if things get too big. (Where "too big" might mean
/// exhausting identifier space or using up too much heap memory in accordance
/// with the configured [`size_limit`](Builder::set_size_limit).)
///
/// # Overview
///
/// ## Adding multiple patterns
///
/// Each pattern you add to an NFA should correspond to a pair of
/// [`Builder::start_pattern`] and [`Builder::finish_pattern`] calls, with
/// calls inbetween that add NFA states for that pattern. NFA states may be
/// added without first calling `start_pattern`, with the exception of adding
/// capturing states.
///
/// ## Adding NFA states
///
/// Here is a very brief overview of each of the methods that add NFA states.
/// Every method adds a single state.
///
/// * [`add_empty`](Builder::add_empty): Add a state with a single
/// unconditional epsilon transition to another state.
/// * [`add_union`](Builder::add_union): Adds a state with unconditional
/// epsilon transitions to two or more states, with earlier transitions
/// preferred over later ones.
/// * [`add_union_reverse`](Builder::add_union_reverse): Adds a state with
/// unconditional epsilon transitions to two or more states, with later
/// transitions preferred over earlier ones.
/// * [`add_range`](Builder::add_range): Adds a state with a single transition
/// to another state that can only be followed if the current input byte is
/// within the range given.
/// * [`add_sparse`](Builder::add_sparse): Adds a state with two or more
/// range transitions to other states, where a transition is only followed
/// if the current input byte is within one of the ranges. All transitions
/// in this state have equal priority, and the corresponding ranges must be
/// non-overlapping.
/// * [`add_look`](Builder::add_look): Adds a state with a single *conditional*
/// epsilon transition to another state, where the condition depends on a
/// limited look-around property.
/// * [`add_capture_start`](Builder::add_capture_start): Adds a state with
/// a single unconditional epsilon transition that also instructs an NFA
/// simulation to record the current input position to a specific location in
/// memory. This is intended to represent the starting location of a capturing
/// group.
/// * [`add_capture_end`](Builder::add_capture_end): Adds a state with
/// a single unconditional epsilon transition that also instructs an NFA
/// simulation to record the current input position to a specific location in
/// memory. This is intended to represent the ending location of a capturing
/// group.
/// * [`add_fail`](Builder::add_fail): Adds a state that never transitions to
/// another state.
/// * [`add_match`](Builder::add_match): Add a state that indicates a match has
/// been found for a particular pattern. A match state is a final state with
/// no outgoing transitions.
///
/// ## Setting transitions between NFA states
///
/// The [`Builder::patch`] method creates a transition from one state to the
/// next. If the `from` state corresponds to a state that supports multiple
/// outgoing transitions (such as "union"), then this adds the corresponding
/// transition. Otherwise, it sets the single transition. (This routine panics
/// if `from` corresponds to a state added by `add_sparse`, since sparse states
/// need more specialized handling.)
///

///
/// This annotated example shows how to hand construct the regex `[a-z]+`
/// (without an unanchored prefix).
///

///     nfa::thompson::{pikevm::PikeVM, Builder, Transition},

/// // Before adding NFA states for our pattern, we need to tell the builder
/// // that we are starting the pattern.
/// builder.start_pattern()?;
/// // Since we use the Pike VM below for searching, we need to add capturing
/// // states. If you're just going to build a DFA from the NFA, then capturing
/// // states do not need to be added.
/// let start = builder.add_capture_start(StateID::ZERO, 0, None)?;
/// let range = builder.add_range(Transition {
///     // We don't know the state ID of the 'next' state yet, so we just fill
///     // in a dummy 'ZERO' value.
///     start: b'a', end: b'z', next: StateID::ZERO,
/// })?;
/// // This state will point back to 'range', but also enable us to move ahead.
/// // That is, this implements the '+' repetition operator. We add 'range' and
/// // then 'end' below to this alternation.
/// let alt = builder.add_union(vec![])?;
/// // The final state before the match state, which serves to capture the
/// // end location of the match.
/// let end = builder.add_capture_end(StateID::ZERO, 0)?;
/// // The match state for our pattern.
/// let mat = builder.add_match()?;
/// // Now we fill in the transitions between states.
/// builder.patch(start, range)?;
/// builder.patch(range, alt)?;
/// // If we added 'end' before 'range', then we'd implement non-greedy
/// // matching, i.e., '+?'.
/// builder.patch(alt, range)?;
/// builder.patch(alt, end)?;
/// builder.patch(end, mat)?;
/// // We must explicitly finish pattern and provide the starting state ID for
/// // this particular pattern.
/// builder.finish_pattern(start)?;
/// // Finally, when we build the NFA, we provide the anchored and unanchored
/// // starting state IDs. Since we didn't bother with an unanchored prefix
/// // here, we only support anchored searching. Thus, both starting states are
/// // the same.
