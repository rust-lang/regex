/// A virtual machine for executing regex searches with capturing groups.

/// # Infallible APIs
///
/// Unlike most other regex engines in this crate, a `PikeVM` never returns an
/// error at search time. It supports all [`Anchored`] configurations, never
/// quits and works on haystacks of arbitrary length.
///
/// There are two caveats to mention though:
///
/// * If an invalid pattern ID is given to a search via [`Anchored::Pattern`],
/// then the PikeVM will report "no match." This is consistent with all other
/// regex engines in this crate.
/// * When using [`PikeVM::which_overlapping_matches`] with a [`PatternSet`]
/// that has insufficient capacity to store all valid pattern IDs, then if a
/// match occurs for a `PatternID` that cannot be inserted, it is silently
/// dropped as if it did not match.
///
/// # Advice
///
/// The `PikeVM` is generally the most "powerful" regex engine in this crate.
/// "Powerful" in this context means that it can handle any regular expression
/// that is parseable by `regex-syntax` and any size haystack. Regretably,
/// the `PikeVM` is also simultaneously often the _slowest_ regex engine in
/// practice. This results in an annoying situation where one generally tries
/// to pick any other regex engine (or perhaps none at all) before being
/// forced to fall back to a `PikeVM`.
///
/// For example, a common strategy for dealing with capturing groups is to
/// actually look for the overall match of the regex using a faster regex
/// engine, like a [lazy DFA](crate::hybrid::regex::Regex). Once the overall
/// match is found, one can then run the `PikeVM` on just the match span to
/// find the spans of the capturing groups. In this way, the faster regex
/// engine does the majority of the work, while the `PikeVM` only lends its
/// power in a more limited role.
///
/// Unfortunately, this isn't always possible because the faster regex engines
/// don't support all of the regex features in `regex-syntax`. This notably
/// includes (and is currently limited to) Unicode word boundaries. So if
/// your pattern has Unicode word boundaries, you typically can't use a
/// DFA-based regex engine at all (unless you [enable heuristic support for
/// it](crate::hybrid::dfa::Config::unicode_word_boundary)). (The [one-pass
/// DFA](crate::dfa::onepass::DFA) can handle Unicode word boundaries for
/// anchored searches only, but in a cruel sort of joke, many Unicode features
/// tend to result in making the regex _not_ one-pass.)
///
/// # Example
///
/// This example shows that the `PikeVM` implements Unicode word boundaries
/// correctly by default.

            // states).

            // whole lot of sense in unanchored searches, because it means the
            // search really cannot terminate until EOF. And often, in that
            // case, you wind up skipping over a bunch of matches and are left
            // with the "last" match. Arguably, it just doesn't make a lot of

/// "closure." Computing an epsilon closure is also done during DFA
/// determinization! Compare and contrast the epsilon closure here in this
/// PikeVM and the one used for determinization in crate::util::determinize.)
///
/// Computing the epsilon closure in a Thompson NFA proceeds via a depth
/// first traversal over all epsilon transitions from a particular state.
/// (A depth first traversal is important because it emulates the same priority
/// of matches that is typically found in backtracking regex engines.) This
/// depth first traversal is naturally expressed using recursion, but to avoid
/// a call stack size proportional to the size of a regex, we put our stack on
/// the heap instead.
///
/// This stack thus consists of call frames. The typical call frame is
/// `Explore`, which instructs epsilon closure to explore the epsilon
/// transitions from that state. (Subsequent epsilon transitions are then
/// pushed on to the stack as more `Explore` frames.) If the state ID being
/// explored has no epsilon transitions, then the capturing group slots are
/// copied from the original state that sparked the epsilon closure (from the
/// 'step' routine) to the state ID being explored. This way, capturing group
/// slots are forwarded from the previous state to the next.
///
/// The other stack frame, `RestoreCaptures`, instructs the epsilon closure to
/// set the position for a particular slot back to some particular offset. This
/// frame is pushed when `Explore` sees a `Capture` transition. `Explore` will
/// set the offset of the slot indicated in `Capture` to the current offset,
/// and then push the old offset on to the stack as a `RestoreCapture` frame.
/// Thus, the new offset is only used until the epsilon closure reverts back to
/// the `RestoreCapture` frame. In effect, this gives the `Capture` epsilon
/// transition its "scope" to only states that come "after" it during depth
/// first traversal.
