// This module contains a couple simple and purpose built hash maps. The key
// trade off they make is that they serve as caches rather than true maps. That
// is, inserting a new entry may cause eviction of another entry. This gives
// us two things. First, there's less overhead associated with inserts and
// lookups. Secondly, it lets us control our memory usage.
//
// These maps are used in some fairly hot code when generating NFA states for
// large Unicode character classes.
//
// Instead of exposing a rich hashmap entry API, we just permit the caller to
// produce a hash of the key directly. The hash can then be reused for both
// lookups and insertions at the cost of leaking abstraction a bit. But these
// are for internal use only, so it's fine.
//
// The Utf8BoundedMap is used for Daciuk's algorithm for constructing a
// (almost) minimal DFA for large Unicode character classes in linear time.
// (Daciuk's algorithm is always used when compiling forward NFAs. For reverse
// NFAs, it's only used when the compiler is configured to 'shrink' the NFA,
// since there's a bit more expense in the reverse direction.)
//
// The Utf8SuffixMap is used when compiling large Unicode character classes for
// reverse NFAs when 'shrink' is disabled. Specifically, it augments the naive
// construction of UTF-8 automata by caching common suffixes. This doesn't
// get the same space savings as Daciuk's algorithm, but it's basically as
// fast as the naive approach and typically winds up using less memory (since
// it generates smaller NFAs) despite the presence of the cache.
//
// These maps effectively represent caching mechanisms for sparse and
// byte-range NFA states, respectively. The former represents a single NFA
// state with many transitions of equivalent priority while the latter
// represents a single NFA state with a single transition. (Neither state ever
// has or is an epsilon transition.) Thus, they have different key types. It's
// likely we could make one generic map, but the machinery didn't seem worth
// it. They are simple enough.

/// A bounded hash map where the key is a sequence of NFA transitions and the
/// value is a pre-existing NFA state ID.
///
/// std's hashmap can be used for this, however, this map has two important
/// advantages. Firstly, it has lower overhead. Secondly, it permits us to
/// control our memory usage by limited the number of slots. In general, the
/// cost here is that this map acts as a cache. That is, inserting a new entry
/// may remove an old entry. We are okay with this, since it does not impact
/// correctness in the cases where it is used. The only effect that dropping
/// states from the cache has is that the resulting NFA generated may be bigger
/// than it otherwise would be.
///
/// This improves benchmarks that compile large Unicode character classes,
/// since it makes the generation of (almost) minimal UTF-8 automaton faster.
/// Specifically, one could observe the difference with std's hashmap via
/// something like the following benchmark:
///
///   hyperfine "regex-cli debug nfa thompson --quiet --reverse '\w{90} ecurB'"
///
/// But to observe that difference, you'd have to modify the code to use
/// std's hashmap.
///
/// It is quite possible that there is a better way to approach this problem.
/// For example, if there happens to be a very common state that collides with
/// a lot of less frequent states, then we could wind up with very poor caching
/// behavior. Alas, the effectiveness of this cache has not been measured.
/// Instead, ad hoc experiments suggest that it is "good enough." Additional
/// smarts (such as an LRU eviction policy) have to be weighed against the
/// amount of extra time they cost.
