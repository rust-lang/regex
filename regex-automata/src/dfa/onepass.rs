/*!
A DFA that can return spans for matching capturing groups.

This module is the home of a [one-pass DFA](DFA).

// A note on naming and credit:
//
// As far as I know, Russ Cox came up with the practical vision and
// implementation of a "one-pass regex engine." He mentions and describes it
// briefly in the third article of his regexp article series:
// https://swtch.com/~rsc/regexp/regexp3.html
//
// Cox's implementation is in RE2, and the implementation below is most
// heavily inspired by RE2's. The key thing they have in common is that
// their transitions are defined over an alphabet of bytes. In contrast,
// Go's regex engine also has a one-pass engine, but its transitions are
// more firmly rooted on Unicode codepoints. The ideas are the same, but the
// implementations are different.
//
// RE2 tends to call this a "one-pass NFA." Here, we call it a "one-pass DFA."
// They're both true in their own ways:
//
// * The "one-pass" criterion is generally a property of the NFA itself. In
// particular, it is said that an NFA is one-pass if, after each byte of input
// during a search, there is at most one "VM thread" remaining to take for the
// next byte of input. That is, there is never any ambiguity as to the path to
// take through the NFA during a search.
//
// * On the other hand, once a one-pass NFA has its representation converted
// to something where a constant number of instructions is used for each byte
// of input, the implementation looks a lot more like a DFA. It's technically
// more powerful than a DFA since it has side effects (storing offsets inside
// of slots activated by a transition), but it is far closer to a DFA than an
// NFA simulation.
//
// Thus, in this crate, we call it a one-pass DFA.

/// A one-pass DFA for executing a subset of anchored regex searches while
/// resolving capturing groups.
///
/// A one-pass DFA can be built from an NFA that is one-pass. An NFA is
/// one-pass when there is never any ambiguity about how to continue a search.
/// For example, `a*a` is not one-pass becuase during a search, it's not
/// possible to know whether to continue matching the `a*` or to move on to
/// the single `a`. However, `a*b` is one-pass, because for every byte in the
/// input, it's always clear when to move on from `a*` to `b`.
///
/// # Only anchored searches are supported
///
/// In this crate, especially for DFAs, unanchored searches are implemented by
/// treating the pattern as if it had a `(?s-u:.)*?` prefix. While the prefix
/// is one-pass on its own, adding anything after it, e.g., `(?s-u:.)*?a` will
/// make the overall pattern not one-pass. Why? Because the `(?s-u:.)` matches
/// any byte, and there is therefore ambiguity as to when the prefix should
/// stop matching and something else should start matching.
///
/// Therefore, one-pass DFAs do not support unanchored searches. In addition
/// to many regexes simply not being one-pass, it implies that one-pass DFAs
/// have limited utility. With that said, when a one-pass DFA can be used, it
/// can potentially provide a dramatic speed up over alternatives like the
/// [`BoundedBacktracker`](crate::nfa::thompson::backtrack::BoundedBacktracker)
/// and the [`PikeVM`](crate::nfa::thompson::pikevm::PikeVM). In particular,
/// a one-pass DFA is the only DFA capable of reporting the spans of matching
/// capturing groups.
///
/// To clarify, when we say that unanchored searches are not supported, what
/// that actually means is:
///
/// * The high level routines, [`DFA::is_match`] and [`DFA::captures`], always
/// do anchored searches.
/// * Since iterators are most useful in the context of unanchored searches,
/// there is no `DFA::captures_iter` method.
/// * For lower level routines like [`DFA::try_search`], an error will be
/// returned if the given [`Input`] is configured to do an unanchored search or
/// search for an invalid pattern ID. (Note that an [`Input`] is configured to
/// do an unanchored search by default, so just giving a `Input::new` is
/// guaranteed to return an error.)
///
/// # Other limitations
///
/// In addition to the [configurable heap limit](Config::size_limit) and
/// the requirement that a regex pattern be one-pass, there are some other
/// limitations:
///
/// * There is an internal limit on the total number of explicit capturing
/// groups that appear across all patterns. It is somewhat small and there is
/// no way to configure it. If your pattern(s) exceed this limit, then building
/// a one-pass DFA will fail.
/// * If the number of patterns exceeds an internal unconfigurable limit, then
/// building a one-pass DFA will fail. This limit is quite large and you're
/// unlikely to hit it.
/// * If the total number of states exceeds an internal unconfigurable limit,
/// then building a one-pass DFA will fail. This limit is quite large and
/// you're unlikely to hit it.
///
/// # Other examples of regexes that aren't one-pass
///
/// One particularly unfortunate example is that enabling Unicode can cause
/// regexes that were one-pass to no longer be one-pass. Consider the regex
/// `(?-u)\w*\s` for example. It is one-pass because there is exactly no
/// overlap between the ASCII definitions of `\w` and `\s`. But `\w*\s`
/// (i.e., with Unicode enabled) is *not* one-pass because `\w` and `\s` get
/// translated to UTF-8 automatons. And while the *codepoints* in `\w` and `\s`
/// do not overlap, the underlying UTF-8 encodings do. Indeed, because of the
/// overlap between UTF-8 automata, the use of Unicode character classes will
/// tend to vastly increase the likelihood of a regex not being one-pass.
///
/// # How does one know if a regex is one-pass or not?
///
/// At the time of writing, the only way to know is to try and build a one-pass
/// DFA. The one-pass property is checked while constructing the DFA.
///
/// This does mean that you might potentially waste some CPU cycles and memory
/// by optimistically trying to build a one-pass DFA. But this is currently the
/// only way. In the future, building a one-pass DFA might be able to use some
/// heuristics to detect common violations of the one-pass property and bail
/// more quickly.
///
/// # Resource usage
///
/// Unlike a general DFA, a one-pass DFA has stricter bounds on its resource
/// usage. Namely, construction of a one-pass DFA has a time and space
/// complexity of `O(n)`, where `n ~ nfa.states().len()`. (A general DFA's time
/// and space complexity is `O(2^n)`.) This smaller time bound is achieved
/// because there is at most one DFA state created for each NFA state. If
/// additional DFA states would be required, then the pattern is not one-pass
/// and construction will fail.
///
/// Note though that currently, this DFA uses a fully dense representation.
/// This means that while its space complexity is no worse than an NFA, it may
/// in practice use more memory because of higher constant factors. The reason
/// for this trade off is two-fold. Firstly, a dense representation makes the
/// search faster. Secondly, the bigger an NFA, the more unlikely it is to be
/// one-pass. Therefore, most one-pass DFAs are usually pretty small.
///
/// # Example
///
/// This example shows that the one-pass DFA implements Unicode word boundaries
/// correctly while simultaneously reporting spans for capturing groups that
/// participate in a match. (This is the only DFA that implements full support
/// for Unicode word boundaries.)
///
/// ```
/// # if cfg!(miri) { return Ok(()); } // miri takes too long

///
/// # Example: iteration
///
/// Unlike other regex engines in this crate, this one does not provide
/// iterator search functions. This is because a one-pass DFA only supports
/// anchored searches, and so iterator functions are generally not applicable.
///
/// However, if you know that all of your matches are

        // PERF: Some ideas. I ran out of steam after my initial impl to try
        // many of these.
        //
        // 1) Try doing more state shuffling. Right now, all we do is push
        // match states to the end of the transition table so that we can do
        // 'if sid >= self.min_match_id' to know whether we're in a match
        // state or not. But what about doing something like dense DFAs and
        // pushing dead, match and states with captures/looks all toward the
        // beginning of the transition table. Then we could do 'if sid <=
        // self.max_special_id', in which case, we need to do some special
        // handling of some sort. Otherwise, we get the happy path, just
        // like in a DFA search. The main argument against this is that the
        // one-pass DFA is likely to be used most often with capturing groups
        // and if capturing groups are common, then this might wind up being a
        // pessimization.
        //
        // 2) Consider moving 'PatternEpsilons' out of the transition table.
        // It is only needed for match states and usually a small minority of
        // states are match states. Therefore, we're using an extra 'u64' for
        // most states.
        //
        // 3) I played around with the match state handling and it seems like
        // there is probably a lot left on the table for improvement. The
        // key tension is that the 'find_match' routine is a giant mess, but
        // splitting it out into a non-inlineable function is a non-starter
        // because the match state might consume input, so 'find_match' COULD
        // be called quite a lot, and a function call at that point would trash
        // perf. In theory, we could detect whether a match state consumes
        // input and then specialize our search routine based on that. In that
        // case, maybe an extra function call is OK, but even then, it might be
        // too much of a latency hit. Another idea is to just try and figure
        // out how to reduce the code size of 'find_match'. RE2 has a trick
        // here where the match handling isn't done if we know the next byte of
        // input yields a match too. Maybe we adopt that?
