// This module provides a relatively simple thread-safe pool of reusable

// costly, in the case where a pool is accessed by the first thread that tried
// to get a value, we bypass the mutex. Here are some benchmarks showing the
// difference.
//
// 2022-10-15: These benchmarks are from the old regex crate and they aren't
// easy to reproduce because some rely on older implementations of Pool that
// are no longer around. I've left the results here for posterity, but any
// enterprising individual should feel encouraged to re-litigate the way Pool
// works. I am not at all certain it is the best approach.

// (1) represents our baseline: the master branch at the time of writing when
// using the 'thread_local' crate to implement the pool below.
//
// (2) represents a naive pool implemented completely via Mutex<Vec<T>>. There
// is no special trick for bypassing the mutex.
//
// (3) is the same as (2), except it uses Mutex<Vec<Box<T>>>. It is twice as
// fast because a Box<T> is much smaller than the T we use with a Pool in this
// crate. So pushing and popping a Box<T> from a Vec is quite a bit faster
// than for T.
//
// (4) is the same as (3), but with the trick for bypassing the mutex in the
// case of the first-to-get thread.
//
// Why move off of thread_local? Even though (4) is a hair faster than (1)
// above, this was not the main goal. The main goal was to move off of
// thread_local and find a way to *simply* re-capture some of its speed for
// regex's specific case. So again, why move off of it? The *primary* reason is
// because of memory leaks. See https://github.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/362
// for example. (Why do I want it to be simple? Well, I suppose what I mean is,
// "use as much safe code as possible to minimize risk and be as sure as I can
// be that it is correct.")
//
// My guess is that the thread_local design is probably not appropriate for
// regex since its memory usage scales to the number of active threads that
// have used a regex, where as the pool below scales to the number of threads
// that simultaneously use a regex. While neither case permits contraction,
// since we own the pool data structure below, we can add contraction if a
// clear use case pops up in the wild. More pressingly though, it seems that
// there are at least some use case patterns where one might have many threads
// sitting around that might have used a regex at one point. While thread_local
// does try to reuse space previously used by a thread that has since stopped,
// its maximal memory usage still scales with the total number of active
// threads. In contrast, the pool below scales with the total number of threads
// *simultaneously* using the pool. The hope is that this uses less memory
// overall. And if it doesn't, we can hopefully tune it somehow.
//
// It seems that these sort of conditions happen frequently
// in FFI inside of other more "managed" languages. This was
// mentioned in the issue linked above, and also mentioned here:
// https://github.com/BurntSushi/rure-go/issues/3. And in particular, users
// confirm that disabling the use of thread_local resolves the leak.
//
// There were other weaker reasons for moving off of thread_local as well.
// Namely, at the time, I was looking to reduce dependencies. And for something
// like regex, maintenance can be simpler when we own the full dependency tree.
//
// Note that I am not entirely happy with this pool. It has some subtle
// implementation details and is overall still observable (even with the
// thread owner optimization) in benchmarks. If someone wants to take a crack
// at building something better, please file an issue. Even if it means a
// different API. The API exposed by this pool is not the minimal thing that
// something like a 'Regex' actually needs. It could adapt to, for example,
// an API more like what is found in the 'thread_local' crate. However, we do
// really need to support the no-std alloc-only context, or else the regex
// crate wouldn't be able to support no-std alloc-only. However, I'm generally
// okay with making the alloc-only context slower (as it is here), although I
// do find it unfortunate.

A thread safe memory pool.

The principal type in this module is a [`Pool`]. It main use case is for
holding a thread safe collection of mutable scratch spaces (usually called
`Cache` in this crate) that regex engines need to execute a search. This then
permits sharing the same read-only regex object across multiple threads while
having a quick way of reusing scratch space in a thread safe way. This avoids
needing to re-create the scratch space for every search, which could wind up
being quite expensive.
*/

/// A thread safe pool that works in an `alloc`-only context.
///
/// Getting a value out comes with a guard. When that guard is dropped, the
/// value is automatically put back in the pool. The guard provides both a
/// `Deref` and a `DerefMut` implementation for easy access to an underlying
/// `T`.
///
/// A `Pool` impls `Sync` when `T` is `Send` (even if `T` is not `Sync`). This
/// is possible because a pool is guaranteed to provide a value to exactly one
/// thread at any time.
///
/// Currently, a pool never contracts in size. Its size is proportional to the
/// maximum number of simultaneous uses. This may change in the future.
///
/// A `Pool` is a particularly useful data structure for this crate because
/// many of the regex engines require a mutable "cache" in order to execute
/// a search. Since regexes themselves tend to be global, the problem is then:
/// how do you get a mutable cache to execute a search? You could:
///
/// 1. Use a `thread_local!`, which requires the standard library and requires
/// that the regex pattern be statically known.
/// 2. Use a `Pool`.
/// 3. Make the cache an explicit dependency in your code and pass it around.
/// 4. Put the cache state in a `Mutex`, but this means only one search can
/// execute at a time.
/// 5. Create a new cache for every search.
///
/// A `thread_local!` is perhaps the best choice if it works for your use case.
/// Putting the cache in a mutex or creating a new cache for every search are
/// perhaps the worst choices. Of the remaining two choices, whether you use
/// this `Pool` or thread through a cache explicitly in your code is a matter
/// of taste and depends on your code architecture.
///
/// # Warning: may use a spin lock
///
/// When this crate is compiled _without_ the `std` feature, then this type
/// may used a spin lock internally. This can have subtle effects that may
/// be undesirable. See [Spinlocks Considered Harmful][spinharm] for a more
/// thorough treatment of this topic.

            // `UnsafeCell` technique to lazily initialize it. This has the
            // downside of the `Once` now needing to get hit in the owner fast
            // path, but maybe that's OK? However, I then realized that we can
            // only lazily initialize `stacks`, `owner` and `owner_val`. The
            // `create` function needs to be put somewhere outside of the box.
            // So now the pool is a `Box`, `Once` and a function. Now we're
            // starting to defeat the point of boxing in the first place. So I
            // backed out that change too.
            //

// FUTURE: We should consider using Mara Bos's nearly-lock-free version of this
// here: https://gist.github.com/m-ou-se/5fdcbdf7dcf4585199ce2de697f367a4.
//
// One reason why I did things with a "mutex" below is that it isolates the
// safety concerns to just the Mutex, where as the safety of Mara's pool is a
// bit more sprawling. I also expect this code to not be used that much, and
// so is unlikely to get as much real world usage with which to test it. That
// means the "obviously correct" lever is an important one.
//
// The specific reason to use Mara's pool is that it is likely faster and also
// less likely to hit problems with spin-locks, although it is not completely
// impervious to them.
//
// The best solution to this problem, probably, is a truly lock free pool. That
// could be done with a lock free linked list. The issue is the ABA problem. It
// is difficult to avoid, and doing so is complex. BUT, the upshot of that is
// that if we had a truly lock free pool, then we could also use it above in
// the 'std' pool instead of a Mutex because it should be completely free the
// problems that come from spin-locks.
