/*!
This module contains types and routines for implementing determinization.

In this crate, there are at least two places where we implement
determinization: fully ahead-of-time compiled DFAs in the `dfa` module and
lazily compiled DFAs in the `hybrid` module. The stuff in this module
corresponds to the things that are in common between these implementations.

There are three broad things that our implementations of determinization have
in common, as defined by this module:

* The classification of start states. That is, whether we're dealing with
word boundaries, line boundaries, etc., is all the same. This also includes
the look-behind assertions that are satisfied by each starting state
classification.
* The representation of DFA states as sets of NFA states, including
convenience types for building these DFA states that are amenable to reusing
allocations.
* Routines for the "classical" parts of determinization: computing the
epsilon closure, tracking match states (with corresponding pattern IDs, since
we support multi-pattern finite automata) and, of course, computing the
transition function between states for units of input.

I did consider a couple of alternatives to this particular form of code reuse:

1. Don't do any code reuse. The problem here is that we *really* want both
forms of determinization to do exactly identical things when it comes to
their handling of NFA states. While our tests generally ensure this, the code
is tricky and large enough where not reusing code is a pretty big bummer.

2. Implement all of determinization once and make it generic over fully
compiled DFAs and lazily compiled DFAs. While I didn't actually try this
approach, my instinct is that it would be more complex than is needed here.
And the interface required would be pretty hairy. Instead, I think splitting
it into logical sub-components works better.

                // re-visiting them. In exchange, we have to do this second
                // iteration over our collected states to finalize our DFA
                // state. In theory, we could avoid this second iteration if
                // we maintained two sets during epsilon closure: the set of
                // visited states (to avoid cycles) and the set of states that
                // will actually be used to construct the next DFA state.
                //
                // Note that this optimization requires that we re-compute the
                // epsilon closure to account for look-ahead in 'next' *only
                // when necessary*. Namely, only when the set of look-around
                // assertions changes and only when those changes are within
                // the set of assertions that are needed in order to step
                // through the closure correctly. Otherwise, if we re-do the
                // epsilon closure needlessly, it could change based on the
                // fact that we are omitting epsilon states here.

                //
                // Welp, scratch the above. It turns out that recording these
                // is in fact necessary to seemingly handle one particularly
                // annoying case: when a conditional epsilon transition is
                // put inside of a repetition operator. One specific case I
                // ran into was the regex `(?:\b|%)+` on the haystack `z%`.
                // The correct leftmost first matches are: [0, 0] and [1, 1].
                // But the DFA was reporting [0, 0] and [1, 2]. To understand
                // why this happens, consider the NFA for the aforementioned
                // regex:
                //
                //     >000000: binary-union(4, 1)
                //      000001: \x00-\xFF => 0
                //      000002: WordAscii => 5
                //      000003: % => 5
                //     ^000004: binary-union(2, 3)
                //      000005: binary-union(4, 6)
                //      000006: MATCH(0)
                //
                // The problem here is that one of the DFA start states is
                // going to consist of the NFA states [2, 3] by computing the
                // epsilon closure of state 4. State 4 isn't included because
                // we previously were not keeping track of union states. But
                // only a subset of transitions out of this state will be able
                // to follow WordAscii, and in those cases, the epsilon closure
                // is redone. The only problem is that computing the epsilon
                // closure from [2, 3] is different than computing the epsilon
                // closure from [4]. In the former case, assuming the WordAscii
                // assertion is satisfied, you get: [2, 3, 6]. In the latter
                // case, you get: [2, 6, 3]. Notice that '6' is the match state
                // and appears AFTER '3' in the former case. This leads to a
                // preferential but incorrect match of '%' before returning
                // a match. In the latter case, the match is preferred over
                // continuing to accept the '%'.
                //
                // It almost feels like we might be able to fix the NFA states
                // to avoid this, or to at least only keep track of union
                // states where this actually matters, since in the vast
                // majority of cases, this doesn't matter.
                //
                // Another alternative would be to define a new HIR property
                // called "assertion is repeated anywhere" and compute it
                // inductively over the entire pattern. If it happens anywhere,
