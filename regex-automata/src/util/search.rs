/// The parameters for a regex search including the haystack to search.
///
/// It turns out that regex searches have a few parameters, and in most cases,
/// those parameters have defaults that work in the vast majority of cases.
/// This `Input` type exists to make that common case seamnless while also
/// providing an avenue for changing the parameters of a search. In particular,
/// this type enables doing so without a combinatorial explosion of different
/// methods and/or superfluous parameters in the common cases.
///
/// An `Input` permits configuring the following things:
///
/// * Search only a substring of a haystack, while taking the broader context
/// into account for resolving look-around assertions.
/// * Indicating whether to search for all patterns in a regex, or to
/// only search for one pattern in particular.
/// * Whether to perform an anchored on unanchored search.
/// * Whether to report a match as early as possible.
///
/// All of these parameters, except for the haystack, have sensible default
/// values. This means that the minimal search configuration is simply a call
/// to [`Input::new`] with your haystack. Setting any other parameter is
/// optional.
///
/// Moreover, for any `H` that implements `AsRef<[u8]>`, there exists a
/// `From<H> for Input` implementation. This is useful because many of the
/// search APIs in this crate accept an `Into<Input>`. This means you can
/// provide string or byte strings to these routines directly, and they'll
/// automatically get converted into an `Input` for you.
///
/// The lifetime parameter `'h` refers to the lifetime of the haystack.
///
/// # Organization
///
/// The API of `Input` is split into a few different parts:
///
/// * A builder-like API that transforms a `Input` by value. Examples:
/// [`Input::span`] and [`Input::anchored`].
/// * A setter API that permits mutating parameters in place. Examples:
/// [`Input::set_span`] and [`Input::set_anchored`].
/// * A getter API that permits retrieving any of the search parameters.
/// Examples: [`Input::get_span`] and [`Input::get_anchored`].
/// * A few convenience getter routines that don't conform to the above naming
/// pattern due to how common they are. Examples: [`Input::haystack`],
/// [`Input::start`] and [`Input::end`].
/// * Miscellaneous predicates and other helper routines that are useful
/// in some contexts. Examples: [`Input::is_char_boundary`].
///
/// A `Input` exposes so much because it is meant to be used by both callers of
/// regex engines _and_ implementors of regex engines. A constraining factor is
/// that regex engines should accept a `&Input` as its lowest level API, which
/// means that implementors should only use the "getter" APIs of a `Input`.
///
/// # Valid bounds and search termination
///
/// An `Input` permits setting the bounds of a search via either
/// [`Input::span`] or [`Input::range`]. The bounds set must be valid, or
/// else a panic will occur. Bounds are valid if and only if:
///
/// * The bounds represent a valid range into the input's haystack.
/// * **or** the end bound is a valid ending bound for the haystack *and*
/// the start bound is exactly one greater than the start bound.
///
/// In the latter case, [`Input::is_done`] will return true and indicates any
/// search receiving such an input should immediately return with no match.
///
/// Note that while `Input` is used for reverse searches in this crate, the
/// `Input::is_done` predicate assumes a forward search. Because unsigned
/// offsets are used internally, there is no way to tell from only the offsets
/// whether a reverse search is done or not.
///
/// # Regex engine support
///
/// Any regex engine accepting an `Input` must support at least the following
/// things:
///
/// * Searching a `&[u8]` for matches.
/// * Searching a substring of `&[u8]` for a match, such that any match
/// reported must appear entirely within that substring.
/// * For a forwards search, a match should never be reported when
/// [`Input::is_done`] returns true. (For reverse searches, termination should
/// be handled outside of `Input`.)
///
/// Supporting other aspects of an `Input` are optional, but regex engines
/// should handle aspects they don't support gracefully. How this is done is
/// generally up to the regex engine. This crate generally treats unsupported
/// anchored modes as an error to report for example, but for simplicity, in
/// the meta regex engine, trying to search with an invalid pattern ID just
/// results in no match being reported.

    /// When a search is anchored (so that's [`Anchored::Yes`] or

    /// When a search is not anchored (that's [`Anchored::No`]), regex engines

    /// **WARNING:** this is subtly different than using a `^` at the start of
    /// your regex. A `^` forces a regex to match exclusively at the start of
    /// a haystack, regardless of where you begin your search. In contrast,
    /// anchoring a search will allow your regex to match anywhere in your
    /// haystack, but the match must start at the beginning of a search.
    ///
    /// For example, consider the haystack `aba` and the following searches:
    ///
    /// 1. The regex `^a` is compiled with `Anchored::No` and searches `aba`
    ///    starting at position `2`. Since `^` requires the match to start at
    ///    the beginning of the haystack and `2 > 0`, no match is found.
    /// 2. The regex `a` is compiled with `Anchored::Yes` and searches `aba`
    ///    starting at position `2`. This reports a match at `[2, 3]` since
    ///    the match starts where the search started. Since there is no `^`,
    ///    there is no requirement for the match to start at the beginning of
    ///    the haystack.
    /// 3. The regex `a` is compiled with `Anchored::Yes` and searches `aba`
    ///    starting at position `1`. Since `b` corresponds to position `1` and
    ///    since the search is anchored, it finds no match. While the regex
    ///    matches at other positions, configuring the search to be anchored
    ///    requires that it only report a match that begins at the same offset
    ///    as the beginning of the search.
    /// 4. The regex `a` is compiled with `Anchored::No` and searches `aba`
    ///    starting at position `1`. Since the search is not anchored and
    ///    the regex does not start with `^`, the search executes as if there
    ///    is a `(?s:.)*?` prefix that permits it to match anywhere. Thus, it
    ///    reports a match at `[2, 3]`.
    ///
    /// Note that the [`Anchored::Pattern`] mode is like `Anchored::Yes`,

/// running the regex `foofoofoo|foofoo|foo` on the haystack `foofoo`. In this
/// case, both the `foofoo` and `foo` branches match at position `0`. So should
/// the end of the match be `3` or `6`?
///
/// A backtracker will conceptually work by trying `foofoofoo` and failing.
/// Then it will try `foofoo`, find the match and stop there. Thus, the
/// leftmost-first match position is `6`. This is called "leftmost-first" or
/// "preference order" because the order of the branches as written in the
/// regex pattern is what determines how to break the tie.
///
/// (Note that leftmost-longest match semantics, which break ties by always
/// taking the longest matching string, are not currently supported by this
/// crate. These match semantics tend to be found in POSIX regex engines.)
///
/// This example shows how leftmost-first semantics work, and how it even
/// applies to multi-pattern regexes:
///
/// ```
/// use regex_automata::{
///     nfa::thompson::pikevm::PikeVM,

/// };
///
/// let re = PikeVM::new_many(&[
///     r"foofoofoo",

/// let expected = vec![Match::must(1, 0..6)];
/// assert_eq!(expected, got);
///
/// # Ok::<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>>(())
/// ```
///
/// # All matches
///
/// The `All` match semantics report any and all matches, and generally will
/// attempt to match as much as possible. It doesn't respect any sort of match
/// priority at all, so things like non-greedy matching don't work in this
/// mode.
///
/// The fact that non-greedy matching doesn't work generally makes most forms
/// of unanchored non-overlapping searches have unintuitive behavior. Namely,
/// unanchored searches behave as if there is a `(?s-u:.)*?` prefix at the
/// beginning of the pattern, which is specifically non-greedy. Since it will
/// be treated as greedy in `All` match semantics, this generally means that
/// it will first attempt to consume all of the haystack and is likely to wind
/// up skipping matches.
///
/// Generally speaking, `All` should only be used in two circumstances:
///
/// * When running an anchored search and there is a desire to match as much as
/// possible. For example, when building a reverse regex matcher to find the
/// start of a match after finding the end. In this case, the reverse search
/// is anchored to the end of the match found by the forward search.
/// * When running overlapping searches. Since `All` encodes all possible
/// matches, this is generally what you want for an overlapping search. If you
/// try to use leftmost-first in an overlapping search, it is likely to produce
/// counter-intuitive results since leftmost-first specifically excludes some
/// matches from its underlying finite state machine.
///
/// This example demonstrates the counter-intuitive behavior of `All` semantics
/// when using a standard leftmost unanchored search:
///
/// ```
/// use regex_automata::{
///     nfa::thompson::pikevm::PikeVM,
///     Match, MatchKind,
/// };
///
/// let re = PikeVM::builder()
///     .configure(PikeVM::config().match_kind(MatchKind::All))

/// let mut cache = re.create_cache();

/// Normally, when one searches for something, the response is either an

/// all." However, in some cases, a regex engine can be configured to stop its
/// search before concluding whether a match exists or not. When this happens,
/// it may be important for the caller to know why the regex engine gave up and
/// where in the input it gave up at. This error type exposes the 'why' and the
/// 'where.'
///
/// For example, the DFAs provided by this library generally cannot correctly
/// implement Unicode word boundaries. Instead, they provide an option to
/// eagerly support them on ASCII text (since Unicode word boundaries are
/// equivalent to ASCII word boundaries when searching ASCII text), but will
/// "give up" if a non-ASCII byte is seen. In such cases, one is usually
/// required to either report the failure to the caller (unergonomic) or
/// otherwise fall back to some other regex engine (ergonomic, but potentially
/// costly).
///
/// More generally, some regex engines offer the ability for callers to specify
/// certain bytes that will trigger the regex engine to automatically quit if
/// they are seen.
///
/// Still yet, there may be other reasons for a failed match. For example,
/// the hybrid DFA provided by this crate can be configured to give up if it
/// believes that it is not efficient. This in turn permits callers to choose a
/// different regex engine.
///
/// (Note that DFAs are configured by default to never quit or give up in this

/// pattern contains a Unicode word boundary. One needs to opt into the "quit"
/// behavior via options, like
/// [`hybrid::dfa::Config::unicode_word_boundary`](crate::hybrid::dfa::Config::unicode_word_boundary).)
