/*!
A lazily initialized value for safe sharing between threads.

The principal type in this module is `Lazy`, which makes it easy to construct
values that are shared safely across multiple threads simultaneously.
*/

use core::fmt;

/// A lazily initialized value that implements `Deref` for `T`.
///
/// A `Lazy` takes an initialization function and permits callers from any
/// thread to access the result of that initialization function in a safe
/// manner. In effect, this permits one-time initialization of global resources
/// in a (possibly) multi-threaded program.
///
/// This type and its functionality are available even when neither the `alloc`
/// nor the `std` features are enabled. In exchange, a `Lazy` does **not**
/// guarantee that the given `create` function is called at most once. It
/// might be called multiple times. Moreover, a call to `Lazy::get` (either
/// explicitly or implicitly via `Lazy`'s `Deref` impl) may block until a `T`
/// is available.
///
/// This is very similar to `lazy_static` or `once_cell`, except it doesn't
/// guarantee that the initialization function will be run once and it works
/// in no-alloc no-std environments. With that said, if you need stronger
/// guarantees or a more flexible API, then it is recommended to use either
/// `lazy_static` or `once_cell`.
///
/// # Warning: may use a spin lock
///
/// When this crate is compiled _without_ the `alloc` feature, then this type
/// may used a spin lock internally. This can have subtle effects that may
/// be undesirable. See [Spinlocks Considered Harmful][spinharm] for a more
/// thorough treatment of this topic.
///
/// [spinharm]: https://matklad.github.io/2020/01/02/spinlocks-considered-harmful.html
///
/// # Example
///
/// This type is useful for creating regexes once, and then using them from
/// multiple threads simultaneously without worrying about synchronization.
///
/// ```
/// use regex_automata::{dfa::regex::Regex, util::lazy::Lazy, Match};
///
/// static RE: Lazy<Regex> = Lazy::new(|| Regex::new("foo[0-9]+bar").unwrap());
///
/// let expected = Some(Match::must(0, 3..14));
/// assert_eq!(expected, RE.find(b"zzzfoo12345barzzz"));
