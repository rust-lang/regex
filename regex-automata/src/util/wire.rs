*/

/*
A collection of helper functions, types and traits for serializing automata.

This crate defines its own bespoke serialization mechanism for some structures
provided in the public API, namely, DFAs. A bespoke mechanism was developed
primarily because structures like automata demand a specific binary format.
Attempting to encode their rich structure in an existing serialization
format is just not feasible. Moreover, the format for each structure is
generally designed such that deserialization is cheap. More specifically, that
deserialization can be done in constant time. (The idea being that you can
embed it into your binary or mmap it, and then use it immediately.)

In order to achieve this, the dense and sparse DFAs in this crate use an
in-memory representation that very closely corresponds to its binary serialized
form. This pervades and complicates everything, and in some cases, requires
dealing with alignment and reasoning about safety.

This technique does have major advantages. In particular, it permits doing
the potentially costly work of compiling a finite state machine in an offline
manner, and then loading it at runtime not only without having to re-compile
the regex, but even without the code required to do the compilation. This, for
example, permits one to use a pre-compiled DFA not only in environments without
Rust's standard library, but also in environments without a heap.

In the code below, whenever we insert some kind of padding, it's to enforce a
4-byte alignment, unless otherwise noted. Namely, u32 is the only state ID type
supported. (In a previous version of this library, DFAs were generic over the
state ID representation.)

Also, serialization generally requires the caller to specify endianness,
where as deserialization always assumes native endianness (otherwise cheap
deserialization would be impossible). This implies that serializing a structure
generally requires serializing both its big-endian and little-endian variants,
and then loading the correct one based on the target's endianness.
