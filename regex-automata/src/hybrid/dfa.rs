///
/// These are special states indicating status conditions of a search: unknown,

/// minimum memory needed for a lazy DFA cache.

/// A hybrid NFA/DFA (also called a "lazy DFA") for regex searching.
///
/// A lazy DFA is a DFA that builds itself at search time. It otherwise has
/// very similar characteristics as a [`dense::DFA`](crate::dfa::dense::DFA).
/// Indeed, both support precisely the same regex features with precisely the
/// same semantics.
///
/// Where as a `dense::DFA` must be completely built to handle any input before
/// it may be used for search, a lazy DFA starts off effectively empty. During
/// a search, a lazy DFA will build itself depending on whether it has already
/// computed the next transition or not. If it has, then it looks a lot like
/// a `dense::DFA` internally: it does a very fast table based access to find
/// the next transition. Otherwise, if the state hasn't been computed, then it
/// does determinization _for that specific transition_ to compute the next DFA
/// state.
///
/// The main selling point of a lazy DFA is that, in practice, it has
/// the performance profile of a `dense::DFA` without the weakness of it
/// taking worst case exponential time to build. Indeed, for each byte of
/// input, the lazy DFA will construct as most one new DFA state. Thus, a
/// lazy DFA achieves worst case `O(mn)` time for regex search (where `m ~
/// pattern.len()` and `n ~ haystack.len()`).
///
/// The main downsides of a lazy DFA are:
///
/// 1. It requires mutable "cache" space during search. This is where the
/// transition table, among other things, is stored.
/// 2. In pathological cases (e.g., if the cache is too small), it will run
/// out of room and either require a bigger cache capacity or will repeatedly
/// clear the cache and thus repeatedly regenerate DFA states. Overall, this
/// will tend to be slower than a typical NFA simulation.
///
/// # Capabilities
///
/// Like a `dense::DFA`, a single lazy DFA fundamentally supports the following
/// operations:
///
/// 1. Detection of a match.
/// 2. Location of the end of a match.
/// 3. In the case of a lazy DFA with multiple patterns, which pattern matched
/// is reported as well.
///
/// A notable absence from the above list of capabilities is the location of
/// the *start* of a match. In order to provide both the start and end of
/// a match, *two* lazy DFAs are required. This functionality is provided by a
/// [`Regex`](crate::hybrid::regex::Regex).
///
/// # Example
///
/// This shows how to build a lazy DFA with the default configuration and
/// execute a search. Notice how, in contrast to a `dense::DFA`, we must create
/// a cache and pass it to our search routine.
///
/// ```

/// A builder for constructing a lazy deterministic finite automaton from
/// regular expressions.
///
/// As a convenience, [`DFA::builder`] is an alias for [`Builder::new`]. The
/// advantage of the former is that it often lets you avoid importing the
/// `Builder` type directly.
///
/// This builder provides two main things:
///
/// 1. It provides a few different `build` routines for actually constructing
/// a DFA from different kinds of inputs. The most convenient is
/// [`Builder::build`], which builds a DFA directly from a pattern string. The
/// most flexible is [`Builder::build_from_nfa`], which builds a DFA straight
/// from an NFA.
/// 2. The builder permits configuring a number of things.
/// [`Builder::configure`] is used with [`Config`] to configure aspects of
/// the DFA and the construction process itself. [`Builder::syntax`] and
/// [`Builder::thompson`] permit configuring the regex parser and Thompson NFA
/// construction, respectively. The syntax and thompson configurations only
/// apply when building from a pattern string.
///
/// This builder always constructs a *single* lazy DFA. As such, this builder
/// can only be used to construct regexes that either detect the presence
/// of a match or find the end location of a match. A single DFA cannot
/// produce both the start and end of a match. For that information, use a
/// [`Regex`](crate::hybrid::regex::Regex), which can be similarly configured
/// using [`regex::Builder`](crate::hybrid::regex::Builder). The main reason
/// to use a DFA directly is if the end location of a match is enough for your
/// use case. Namely, a `Regex` will construct two lazy DFAs instead of one,
/// since a second reverse DFA is needed to find the start of a match.
///
/// # Example
///
/// This example shows how to build a lazy DFA that uses a tiny cache capacity
/// and completely disables Unicode. That is:
///
/// * Things such as `\w`, `.` and `\b` are no longer Unicode-aware. `\w`
///   and `\b` are ASCII-only while `.` matches any byte except for `\n`
///   (instead of any UTF-8 encoding of a Unicode scalar value except for
///   `\n`). Things that are Unicode only, such as `\pL`, are not allowed.
/// * The pattern itself is permitted to match invalid UTF-8. For example,
///   things like `[^a]` that match any byte except for `a` are permitted.
///
