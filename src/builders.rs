#![allow(warnings)]

// This module defines an internal builder that encapsulates all interaction
// with meta::Regex construction, and then 4 public API builders that wrap
// around it. The docs are essentially repeated on each of the 4 public
// builders, with tweaks to the examples as needed.
//
// The reason why there are so many builders is partially because of a misstep
// in the initial API design: the builder constructor takes in the pattern
// strings instead of using the `build` method to accept the pattern strings.
// This means `new` has a different signature for each builder. It probably
// would have been nicer to to use one builder with `fn new()`, and then add
// `build(pat)` and `build_many(pats)` constructors.
//
// The other reason is because I think the `bytes` module should probably
// have its own builder type. That way, it is completely isolated from the
// top-level API.
//
// If I could do it again, I'd probably have a `regex::Builder` and a
// `regex::bytes::Builder`. Each would have `build` and `build_set` (or
// `build_many`) methods for constructing a single pattern `Regex` and a
// multi-pattern `RegexSet`, respectively.

        /// is disabled. (Since the UTF-8 encoding of `ðŸ’©` is 4 bytes long.)

        /// * Unicode character classes like `\p{Letter}` and `\p{Greek}` are
        /// available.

        /// * The word boundary assertions, `\b` and `\B`, use the Unicode
        /// definition of a word character.
