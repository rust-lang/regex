# This file represent tests that may be expensive to run on some regex engines.
# For example, tests that build a full DFA ahead of time and minimize it can
# take a horrendously long time on regexes that are large (or result in an
# explosion in the number of states). We group these tests together so that
# such engines can simply skip these tests.

# See: https://github.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/98

# This test is meant to blow the bounded backtracker's visited capacity. In
# order to do that, we need a somewhat sizeable regex. The purpose of this
# is to make sure there's at least one test that exercises this path in the
# backtracker. All other tests (at time of writing) are small enough that the
# backtracker can handle them fine.
